# Continuous architecture principles

Klnowledge distilled from the book "[Continuous Architecture](./continuous-architecture.md) in practices : Software architecture in the age of Agility and DevOps".

---

## Overview

1. Architect products, evolve from projects to products
2. Focus on quality attributes, not on functional requirements
3. Delay design decisions until they are absolutey necessary
4. Architect for change--leverage the "power of small"
5. Architect for build, test, deploy and operate
6. Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on

## Tools

A set of appropriate tools should be considered to make principles a reality, for example trees and decision logs.

## Key components

Those 6 principles should be sided with a few components well defining the system we worked on :

- Context of the system
- Key functional requirements that will impact the architecture
- Architecture and Design decison (C4 model and ADR)
- Architecture blueprints (UML, SysMl mostly)
