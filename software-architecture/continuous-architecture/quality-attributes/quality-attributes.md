# Quality-attributes

Maybe one the most important concept [continuous architecture](continuous-architecture.md)
Consists of all non-functional attributes that the system meet in delivering functional requirements.
As a simplifcation, QA can be called as **illities** :

- scalability
- usability
- reliability
- [performance](./performance.md)
- [resilience](resilience.md)
