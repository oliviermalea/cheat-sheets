# Software Architecture Document

## Introduction

The introduction should provide an overview of the system architecture document, including the purpose and scope of the document. It should also identify the audience for the document.

## Architectural Goals and Constraints

This section should outline the goals and constraints for the system architecture. This includes functional and non-functional requirements, as well as any technical, financial, or operational constraints.

## Architectural Design

The architectural design section should describe the overall structure of the system, including any subsystems and modules. It should also include a high-level overview of the system's components, interfaces, and functionality.

## Design Rationale

This section should provide a detailed analysis of the design decisions that were made during the development of the system architecture. This includes the reasoning behind the choice of specific technologies and frameworks, as well as any trade-offs that were considered.

## Views and Perspectives

This section should provide multiple views of the system architecture, including both static and dynamic views. This includes conceptual, logical, and physical views of the architecture.

## Conclusion

The conclusion should summarize the findings of the software architecture document, including any recommendations for future improvements or modifications. It should also reiterate the purpose and scope of the document.

## References

This section should provide a list of all references used throughout the software architecture document. This includes both internal and external references, such as technical specifications, reports, and research papers.
