# Specification

---

## Overview

Encapsulates query logic in its own class, which helps classes follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and promotes reuse of common queries.

An elegant solution to the problem of where to place querying, sorting, and paging logic is to use a Specification.

The Specification design pattern describes a query in an object. So to encapsulate a paged query that searches for some products, one might create a PagedProduct specification which would take in any necessary parameters (pageSize, pageNumber, filter).
