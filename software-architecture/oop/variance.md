# Variance

Variance refers to how subtyping between more complex types relates to subtyping between their components.

For example, assuming the type Cat is a subtype of Animal, then an expression of type Cat should be substitutable wherever an expression of type Animal is used.

## Covariance and Contravariance (computer science)

**Covariance** is the quality of being different by being more specific _(Cat is covariant to Animal)_ while **Contravariance** is the quality of being different by being more general _(Animal is contravariant to Cat)_.
